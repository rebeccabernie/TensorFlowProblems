This problem sheet relates to the python library [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and the [Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).  

The [TensorFlow.ipynb](https://github.com/rebeccabernie/TensorFlowProblems/blob/master/TensorFlow.ipynb) notebook uses TensorFlow to create a model and splits the data into training and testing sets. The model is then trained and tested using the relevant sets.
